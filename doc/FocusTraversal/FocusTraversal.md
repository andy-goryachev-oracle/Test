# Public Focus Traversal API (Draft)

<andy.goryachev@oracle.com>


## Summary

Establishes a public API for focus traversal within a JavaFX application.



## Goals

The goals of this proposal are:

- facilitate the changing of the focused Node (focus traversal) using the public API
- allow for setting a custom traversal policy on a **javafx.scene.Parent**



## Non-Goals

It is not a goal of this proposal:

- to introduce a new focus traversal logic or alter the existing one
- to allow for focus traversal configuration via CSS



## Motivation

While focus traversal is currently implemented in JavaFX, there is no public API to access it,
making it nearly impossible for an application to provide custom focus control [0].

The lack of public API makes it impossible for a custom skin or custom control which requires
keyboard navigation to support focus traversal within the control or transfer focus outside of the custom
control.

The lack of public API also represents a functional gap between JavaFX and Swing.





## Description

The focus traversal API supports two major functions:

- changing focus away from the currently focused Node to an adjacent focusable Node as a response to key presses
(such as Tab, Shift+Tab, or arrow keys)
- customizing traversal order within a single **java.scene.Parent**

The focus traversal is provided by the **FocusTraversal** class which offers static methods
for traversing focus in various directions, determined by the **TraversalDirection** enum.

A new property, called `traversalPolicy`, is added to **java.scene.Parent**.  This property enables
customization of the order of traversal within the said parent, by specifying a custom **TraversalPolicy**.

Public focus traversal API classes reside in **javafx.scene.traversal** package [1].



### FocusTraversal

This class provides one general purpose static method which performs focus traversal from the given Node
in the directions specified by the **TraversalDirection** enum:

- public static boolean **traverse**(Node node, TraversalDirection dir, TraversalMethod method)

This class also provides a number of convenience methods with the goal of simplifying code
that needs focus traversal using the keyboard:

- public static boolean **traverseDown**(Node node)
- public static boolean **traverseLeft**(Node node)
- public static boolean **traverseNext**(Node node)
- public static boolean **traverseNextInLine**(Node node)
- public static boolean **traversePrevious**(Node node)
- public static boolean **traverseRight**(Node node)
- public static boolean **traverseUp**(Node node)

**TraversalMethod** differentiates focus traversal resulting from key press versus those resulting from
mouse clicks or programmatic changes.

A typical use of the `FocusTraversal` class is in built-in and custom skins, as a response to keyboard
navigation key presses:

```java
    Node from = ...
    KeyEvent ev = ...
    if(!ev.isAltDown() && !ev.isControlDown() && !ev.isMetaDown() && !ev.isShiftDown() && !ev.isShortcutDown()) {
        switch (ev.getCode()) {
        case UP:
            FocusTraversal.traverse(from, TraversalDirection.UP, TraversalMethod.KEY);
	        ev.consume();
	        break;
	    case DOWN:
	        // or use the convenience method
	        FocusTraversal.traverseDown(from);
	        ev.consume();
	        break;
	    }
	}
```


### Focus Traversal Policy

In many scenarios, the built-in focus traversal logic is sufficient.  In the situations where a custom traversal
is required, or traversal depends on some condition, a custom traversal policy might be needed.
The **TraversalPolicy** abstract class, together with the new `traversalPolicy` property in **java.scene.Parent**,
allows for creation of custom focus traversal policies.  A custom policy must implement the following methods:

- public abstract Node **select**(Parent root, Node owner, TraversalDirection dir)
- public abstract Node **selectFirst**(Parent root)
- public abstract Node **selectLast**(Parent root)

The base class also provides several methods required for implementing a fully functional policy:

- protected Node **findNextFocusableNode**(Parent root, Node node)
- protected Node **findNextInLineFocusableNode**(Parent root, Node node)
- protected Node **findPreviousFocusableNode**(Parent root, Node node)
- public boolean **isParentTraversable**(Parent root)

The default policy, which is used in many standard Controls, is accessible via the following method:

- public static TraversalPolicy **getDefault**()



## Alternatives

Apart from using **Node.requestFocus()** in some limited scenarios,
there is currently no real alternative to the proposed API.



## Testing

This proposal relies on the existing unit tests and new tests that exercise the new API.
Additional behavior test suite [2] wouldn't hurt either.



## Risks and Assumptions

The proposed API basically makes the existing internal logic public (with minor refactoring).
It is possible that bugs were introduced during the refactoring process.  This risk might be relatively low due to
the existing test suite, and can be further mitigated by creating a behavior test suite [2].



## Dependencies

None.
